Example 4: Text Classification - Categorize conversation into pre-existing buckets already defined by user. (Client Support)
Input Chat Message: "Can you guide me on how to execute a trade for XYZ stock on your mobile app? I'm not finding the option."
finBERT Output: Category - Assistance with Online Trading

In a multi-label classification setup, a single piece of text (like a conversation transcript) can be assigned multiple labels or categories. 
This is useful in scenarios where the content of the conversation covers several topics. 
For example, a customer interaction might include discussion about both "account updates" and "trade inquiries," and the system could tag it with both categories.

For a model to effectively handle multi-label classification, it needs to be trained on a dataset where examples are annotated with all applicable categories.

Example 5: Fill in the Blank -  Replace redacted, missing, or unclear ngrams (words or phrases) with the most probable ngrams based on the context of the surrounding text. (Account Management)
